# Resources for the usages of the command line options
option.usage.inputDir=Mandatory. The directory with the Java source files to check, p.e. the "src" folder in a Maven project, or a single Java source file.
option.usage.outputDir=Mandatory. The directory where the output files should be placed. Must be empty.
option.usage.help=Prints this usage help.
option.usage.format=Specifies the output format. Currently supported: JSON (default), CSV.
option.usage.language=Preferred language for the application and the output. If the given language tag is not supported, \
  no tag is given or one of the output resources is not available for the specified language, \
  English (tag "en") is used as a default fallback.
option.usage.dependencies=Specify a list of dependencies (JARs/(project) source root directories) for the sources/project that is to be analysed. \
  If you give only a single source code file as an input to analyse, you probably want to give the file's project \
  root directory (if the file is part of a project) as a dependency, in order to provide context for the analysis. \
  Beware that with missing/without any external dependencies, some Perfumes might be missed because symbols (e.g. classes) \
  could not be resolved, as their dependencies are missing!
option.usage.batchSize=Sets the batch size for the output. Default: 10000, Min: 100, Max: 500000
