  "name": "JFrame dispose",
  "description": "Instead of calling \"System.exit\", which completely terminates the java virtual machine, the \"javax.swing.JFrame.dispose\" method closes the frame and its assigned resources in a more controlled manner. Closing the application this way, one has to make sure to terminate all running threads programmatically. While this may seem like a downside, it ultimately provides the most control, as ongoing processes can be completed before the program is terminated.",
